    <h2 id=biography>Biography</h2>
    <article>
        Born 1995 in the little german town Wolfenb√ºttel.
        Finished highschool in Hamburg with the highest degree and started a apprenticeship as eventtechnician.
        After completing the apprenticeship, my path lead me to the cruiseship company AIDA, where i worked as light- and videotechnician on board.
        Like that i traveled the Mediterranean, carribbean and baltic seas. Crossed the Atlantic, watched Dolphins at the Azores and did my diving licence.
        But hamburg was calling, why i decided to come back to land and
        work as freelancer. That worked pretty well, but was never perfect.
        Now changes happen and iam learning how to code.
